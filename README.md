# 319-Scheduler
This was a class project imported from ISU's private servers which is why there are no commits. Myself and three others created a calendar and class scheduling app from scratch for a semester-long project in COM S 309 at ISU. I worked on everything in the Schedule package. The Groups aspect was severely underdeveloped unfortunately for the time we had.
